Test code, simple tutorials, etc.

Hi there!

I'm David, noobie to Git and Github, but eager to learn. Preferred programming language as of today (Oct.25th 2016) is Python, having been converted from my previous MATLAB life (yikes). Could also dare to do some R and Java, but not with very high proficiency (yet).
